        <li>1 Large leek, white and light green parts only, diced</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed and minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups vegetable broth</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all four mushrooms types in a large bowl with onions; toss gently to mix</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a very large pot over medium-high heat. Cover the 
            bottom of the pot with one layer of the mushroom-onion mixture. Cook, without moving them 
            around too much, until they begin to brown and caramelize on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir 
            and cook another 3 to 5 minutes to brown the other side. Transfer to a large bowl using 
            a slotted spoon. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the pot, and repeat with another batch. Continue 
            until all mushrooms and onions baked.
        </li>
        <li>Seasoned mushroo-onion mixture with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and 1 tablespoon oil to the pot. Add leek and carrots and 
            saute until leeks turn a light golden color and start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic 
            and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. STir in tomato paste; cook for one minute. Add flour;
            cook and stir for 1 more minute.
        </li>
        <li>Add wine, vegetable broth, tamari, cayenne, thyme, and bay leaves, and scrape up the brown 
            bits at the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Carefully add the mushroon-onion mixture. 
            Bring to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, partly covered, until carrots and onions are tender 
            and sauce has thickened, 30 to 40 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
